## Introduction
The Machine Learning Playground is a project aimed at providing a platform for experimenting and visualizing various machine learning algorithms. The project aims to help users get a quick and easy understanding of different machine learning models by allowing them to upload their own data and build their models on the platform.

## Features
In its first version, the Machine Learning Playground has a k-means clustering playground where users can upload their own data, check initial data features, build k-mean models with different clusters and visualize the output. The platform allows users the ability to adjust various parameters such as the number of clusters and analysis of the final output.

In the future, the project aims to support additional machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision trees and more. Each model will be accopmanied by a dedicated playground which feature similar charcteristics as the current k-mean playground.
